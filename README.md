Created skeleton directory for jqueryPlay


I have some goals to reach with this project that will ultimatley lead me to my portfolio project. 
I will be learning new concepts using my previous knowledge I have gained and built upon within my 6 months diploma course. 

To achieve this I will use jquery documentation to help learn that, as well as browse techniques and examples. 
If there is a concept I try to implement that is beyond my scope of understanding I will take a step back and see how to bridge that gap of what I do know, to get a better grasp of what I need to learn.
