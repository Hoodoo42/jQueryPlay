notes as I learn.

learning switch statements
A conditional statement that does nothing more than check if something is true or false.
- does expression match case value.

switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        statement;
        break;
    case value2:
        statement;
        break;
    case value3:
        statement;
        break;
    default:
        statement;
        break;
}
